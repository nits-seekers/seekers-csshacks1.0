## Additional Features:  

Our project helps users to explore new places and encourages them to travel more and make great memories. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;  

The in-game currency sysytem enables players to earn coins-in-game. These coins can then be exchanged for coupons,vouchers and discounts for upcoming trips.
&nbsp;  

More the user explores hidden places, more they will earn coins and be rewarded with medals accordingly as well as change their psoition in the global rankings.
&nbsp;  

Users can connect with their friends and share each other's posts among themselves. They can also track their friend's trip, but only if their friend wants to share it with them. As an added feature, users can ping other nearby players for help,or, in a vice-versa manner, help a fellow stuck player out, which may grant them a reward in the form of in-game currency.
&nbsp;  

Providing accurate feedback on their recent or old visits will enable the users for rewards.
